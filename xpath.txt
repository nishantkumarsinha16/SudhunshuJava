XPath Axis Family Tree Analogy
The major XPath axes follow family tree terminology:

self:: is you.

Downward:
child:: are your immediate children.
descendant:: are your children, and their children, recursively.
descendant-or-self:: (aka //): are you and your descendants.

Upward:
preceding ::
parent :: is your mother or father.1
ancestor :: are your parent, and your parent's parent, recursively.
ancestor-or-self:: are you and your ancestors.
Sideways (consider elements earlier in the document to be younger):

previous-sibling:: are your younger siblings, in age order.
following-sibling:: are your older siblings, in age order.
previous:: are your younger siblings and their descendants, in age order.
following:: are your older siblings and their descendants, in age order.

//*[contains(@value,'Test')]//following::*[local-name()='svg' and contains(@class,'context-menu-icon')]
